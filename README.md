# About
OSC ToolKit is an Electron powered application that can be used to interact with the Open Shop's services from your PC. This is a GUI alternative to [dhtdht020's osc-dl](https://github.com/dhtdht020/osc-dl) which is made in Python and is **great** if you want to do some advanced actions such as making shell/batch scripts that download a list of homebrew.

### Core Features
These features are a priority to implement. OSC-ToolKit's first purpose is to be intuitive and provide an experience similar to the WSC while expanding certain aspects.
- Manage homebrew software such as copying to and from the SD, as well as managing homebrew on your PC's hard drive.
- Download Homebrew from OSC via the Storefront which can then be either be downloaded directly to SD or stored locally.
- View the latest Open Shop Reel episode, or previous ones.

### Potential Features
These are things I'm interested in implementing, but may or may not be worked on.
- Publishing tools for developers to push updates and manage homebrew store pages they own.
- Area for downloading the latest Open Shop version.
