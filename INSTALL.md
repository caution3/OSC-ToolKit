# Installing OSC ToolKit
You can install OSC ToolKit in multiple ways, the most common way is by using the setup program in [Releases](https://github.com/caution3/OSC-ToolKit/releases).

### Using the Installer
**Recommended for most users.**
1. Download and run.

### Using the Standalone ZIP
**If you can't use the setup program.**
1. Download the ZIP file.
2. Extract the whole ZIP file to a preferably empty directory on your system.
3. Run the `osc-toolkit` program.
> Depending on your security settings, OSC ToolKit may not be able to access your SD Card without permission if you use the Standalone ZIP.

### Using the Source
**Only if you plan on editing the source, theming or downloading a beta branch.**

To be updated. (It will be once the actual project is uploaded here.)
